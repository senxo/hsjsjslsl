# Welcome to the template-discord-introduction wiki!

It's simple to set the profile up. You have this parameter to set up:

- id

The id is the discord profile id. If you want to know how to get the id, go [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) or follow these steps that I quickly made!

* First, you need to right click on your username, and click on "Copy ID"

* Second, you paste the ID you copied after typing `?id=` at the end of the url, just like this!

It's easy, right? Remember: At the start you have to add **?** to make it work.
